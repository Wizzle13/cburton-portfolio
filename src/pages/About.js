                    Hello, I am Chris.
                    <p>
                        I’m a full stack web developer in Southern Minnesota. 
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        I have spent the last two decades in manufacturing. I have built ATV’s, boats, and Indian motorcycles. Do I ride a motorcycle? No, my wife would kill me. Do I want to? Oh yeah. I’ll convince her someday just like I convinced her to marry me and to stop pursuing other, hunkier, possibly God like blonde Chris’s. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        My initial degree was in Information Technology, but it was never enough for me. You see, I love building things hence the motorcycle assembly career. Becoming a full stack developer has led me to merge my two biggest passions, problem solving and developing programs. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I fill the void to create physical objects by spending an exorbitant amount of time designing prototypes for my 3d printer at home. I’m currently designing a display for my wifes (and my) Disneyland pin collection. 
                        When I am not 3D printing, I like to watch movies, read Sci-Fi novels, take road trips and nap. That last one has my heart. Don’t tell my wife.
